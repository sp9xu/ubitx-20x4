uBITX firmware, written for the Raduino/Arduino control of uBITX transceivers

Copyright (C) 2017,  Ashhar Farhan @afarhan

Modified for a 20x4 screen with band readout etc. by VK3DAN.
This version is no longer suitable for 16x2 screens such as those provided in the uBITX kit.
Don't forget to edit ubitx_ui.ino to change the callsign variable to your own callsign.

This version also incorporates the cw sidetone fix written by @phdlee
